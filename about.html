<p>I am a front end web developer and Bootstrap specialist living in Orlando, Florida. I'm the creator of a website called <a href="http://startbootstrap.com">Start Bootstrap</a> which is a library of open source themes and templates for the Bootstrap framework. I personally create and maintain all of the themes available on Start Bootstrap, and they are free to download and use for any purpose!</p>

Under this name, I serve small to medium sized clients with front end development needs, and produce premium digital goods that are for sale on various online marketplaces.</p>
