              <h3>Run for Joy</h3> is an app which focuses on personal elements (form, competition, full names, companies name) for added enjoyment and analysis.
              Unlike sites like strava, etc which focuses on precision instruments, here priority is given to show data of all competitors with their form included along multiple years.
