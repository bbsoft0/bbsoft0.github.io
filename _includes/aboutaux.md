<b>Hi. Iâ€™m Barbu</b>.
<p>
I'm passionate about building great applications while minimizing the artificial complexity that often creeps into projects.  </p>

<p>
Refound my enthusiasm for programming in the beautiful framework <b>Ruby on Rails </b>
 which provides his energy, enthusiasm and fighting spirit for a better tomorrow.</p>
  I'm also interested in
developing mobile web apps, building and architecting API services, DevOps and
Linux server administration. TDD, BDD and CI are also part of my workflow,
making sure to deliver reliable and high quality code.
<p>
Worked with a lot of languages and technologies  in building, optimizing, and delivering a "perfect" user experience. </p>
<p>
Love working with new and inovative
technologies, getting involved in cool projects and meeting clever and
interesting people.
Also a long term Runner, interested in health and running stories.
